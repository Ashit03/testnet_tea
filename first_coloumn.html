        <h1> Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card power demands could make Thor weep </h1>

            Nvidia’s RTX 4090 graphics card is a power-hungry beast, that’s a given, but we weren’t expecting to see some of the figures third-party card manufacturers are recommending for the wattage of the power supply (PSU) necessary for this GPU.

In some cases, we’re looking at a recommendation of 1000W, and one company has even pushed the ask to 1200W, no less, an unthinkable required wattage not so long ago. (Note that this is the wattage of the PSU, not the card usage).

You may be aware that the official recommendation from Nvidia is an 850W PSU, and indeed, this is the level some third-party graphics card makers are sticking to with some of their RTX 4090 boards (even away from entry-level versions).
