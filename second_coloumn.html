            Pros and Cons of Using Btrfs Filesystem in Linux
        </h1>
        <p>
            Whenever you install Linux, you get to choose a file system, especially when you are manually partitioning your disk.
The most common option is Ext4, which is used as default in many desktop Linux distributions. But, after Fedora took the plunge to use Btrfs as its default file system, many desktop Linux users switched to Btrfs.
If you are one of them who want to switch to Btrfs, let me help you by listing the Pros and Cons of Btrfs as a file system. This will help you to decide whether to switch or not.

            What is Btrfs?
For starters, Btrfs is a modern copy-on-write file system for Linux with advanced features for fault tolerance, repair and easy administration. Btrfs uses copy-on-write for all files, which means if a file is modified/written to the storage, the file is not replaced but a copy of the file is created. This mechanism helps to create snapshots with minimum size as the unmodified files need not be copied for creating the snapshot.
Btrfs is licensed under the GPL and is open source.
